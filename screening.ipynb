    "\n",
    "1. **Flexible process management**: It is particularly useful when someone wants to run a process on a \"remote\" machine, and be able to leave office before the end of the process, and be able to \"reconnect\" to the terminal from another place (e.g. home).\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Coping with unstable connection**: It is also VERY useful when the internet connection is unstable, you know then that the disconnection will not trigger the shutdown of the process, as it is done on a simple ssh terminal connection.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Doing dirty parallelization**: The user can create/remove multiple screen sessions. It can serve as a way to do \"manual parallelization\" (e.g. run the same script on different datasets, or with different input parameters). It save you the burden of using nohup, cron, or foreground/background process management with ```&```."
