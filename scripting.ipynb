    "### Example 3: Arguments\n",
    "\n",
    "The scripts that we have written so far don't have any arguments. There are two type of arguments: items and list. In the following two examples, we will see two type of arguments: \n",

    "- Code 1: Count Items in Directory\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Count Items in Directory\n",
    "# Usage: bash code1.sh list\n",
    "ls $1 | wc -l ```\n",
    "`$1` is an item argument. If the argument contains spaces it is better to write `\"$1\"`. If we need more item arguments (also called positional arguments) we can use `$2`, `$3`, ..., `$9`, `${10}`, `${11}`, ... . `#` indicates a comment line.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Code 2: Greet User and Count From 1 Till a Given Number\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Greet User and Count From 1 Till a Given Number\n",
    "# Usage: bash code2.sh username number\n",
    "echo Hello $1\n",
    "for num in $(eval \"echo {1..$2}\")\n",
    "do\n",
    "    echo $num\n",
    "done\n",
    "    ```\n",
    "Notice that the `for` interval is written as `$(eval \"echo {1..$2}\")` instead of `{1..$2}`. The latter expression does not work because of the order of the expressions are executed in bash: the curly brackets is examined before the `$2`. For example if the second argument is 42 then instead of having a list from 1 to 42, we only obtain the string `{1..42}` as an item. Now the former expression starts by evaluating `{1..$2}` as a string, e.g. `{1,..42}` then the expression `echo {1..$2}`, e.g. `echo {1..42}`, is evaluated as an argument of `eval` (this command evaluates its input as a command and returns its output). So we finally obtain the list of numbers between 1 and `$2`, e.g. 1 and 42.\n",
