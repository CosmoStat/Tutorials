    With lenses sampled from Gaussian density field (CLUSTERED_LENSES=True, XI_LENS, DELTA_RMS parameters):
    - Lenses cluster in overdense regions
    - Creates two-halo contribution at scales ~ XI_LENS
    - Data sits ABOVE one-halo theory at large separations
    - VV shows clearest two-halo signal (~27% boost with moderate clustering)
    - Effect mimics LSS large-scale velocity coherence
    Decided to keep uniform lenses for cleaner tutorial, but infrastructure exists for exploring clustering effects.
