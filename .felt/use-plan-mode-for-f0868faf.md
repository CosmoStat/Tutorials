    Decision: Use plan mode when asking Claude to implement new correlation function.

    Rationale:
    - Shows good practice (even if just accepting without modification)
    - Demonstrates how plan mode works
    - Don't have time for multiple attempts → go directly with good practices
    - Naive one-shot approach might not work / might not do what we want

    Counter-considered: one-shot to show failure then iterate — rejected due to time constraints.
