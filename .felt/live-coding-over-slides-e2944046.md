    Format decision: conversation-style presentation while things run, rather than structured slides.

    'Just talking out loud and not having too much text on the screen... just having a conversation with people.'

    Slides generated at end (via reveal.js) serve as:
    1. Takeaway material for attendees
    2. Demo of skill capability
    3. Reveal moment: 'here's how these were made'

    README serves as persistent reference.
