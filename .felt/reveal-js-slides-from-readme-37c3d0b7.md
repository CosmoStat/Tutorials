close-reason: "Plan: Use reveal.js skill to generate slides from README at end of tutorial.\n\nDemo value: \n- Shows skill capability in real time\n- Can reveal how slides were made\n- Skill already in the repo (skills/ directory)\n\nPrevious demo: Claude generated reveal.js slides, used deck-tape to screenshot each slide, then self-reviewed for UI issues — no prompting required."
