    Action item from meeting (Calum):

    - Finish verification part: generate catalogs with known signal
    - Have TreeCorr measure correlation function
    - Overplot theory expectation vs measurement
    - Keep tight and simple — no extraneous concepts
    - Test that spin terminology removal still works

    Current state: Catalogs exist, theory curves exist. Need to ensure clean validation workflow that audience can follow without cosmology background.
