    Assumption: No cosmology background required.

    Reference person: Sadie (hasn't done cosmology, doesn't know correlation functions, doesn't know TreeCorr).

    Implications:
    - Must explain what TreeCorr is and what correlation functions are at high level
    - While install runs, explain the concepts
    - Remove spin field terminology (too daunting)
    - Use velocity field (can be explained briefly)
    - Frame as: 'when we analyze galaxy catalogs for weak lensing, we compute correlation functions using TreeCorr'

    Key principle from co-runner: 'If you use additional concepts as a way to communicate, they cannot freak out because of things not central to points being made.'

    Counter-benefit of Claude discovering concepts: Can show that Claude goes deeper than user's understanding (discovers spin structure in TreeCorr). Segue into dangers.
