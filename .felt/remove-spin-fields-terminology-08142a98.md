close-reason: 'Implemented: Removed ''spin-2 × spin-1'' from README. Now describes shear-velocity correlation without spin formalism. TreeCorr explanation added. Prompt simplified to ''shear-velocity correlation functions for measuring correlations between gravitational shear and transverse velocity fields.'''
