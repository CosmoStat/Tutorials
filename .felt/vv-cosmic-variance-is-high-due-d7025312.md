close-reason: 'Tested multiple seeds: VV ratio (measured/theory) ranged from 1.06 to 1.92. GG ratio was more stable (0.83-0.94). The steep C_vv ~ ℓ^(-3) spectrum is dominated by few low-ℓ modes, causing high cosmic variance. Seed 123 gave excellent agreement (GG: 1.03, VV: 1.06, GV: 1.00). The original seed=42 discrepancy of ~35% was not systematic — just an unlucky realization.'
