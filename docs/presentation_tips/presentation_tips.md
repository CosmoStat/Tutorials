# Tips on preparing a talk 
<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Overview
Duration: 1


### Presentation

⚠️ I am not a professional communicator

📊 As scientists, presenting our work (to a committee, to the public, to other scientists) is important

**Acknowledgments:**
- All people who gave me feedback over the years
- Coursera Presentation Skills
- Massimo Pettorino lectures on spoken communications

### What You will *not* Learn
❌ professional advice (I am not a professional)

❌ making a brilliant talk

❌ become a professional communicator

### What You will Learn

✅ <i class="em em---1" aria-role="presentation" aria-label="THUMBS UP SIGN"></i> become more aware of choices you have/make when preparing your talk

✅ tips to improve your presentation to a minimal level with minimal effort

✅ reconsider some misconceptions


*This tutorial is not about making a great presentation. It’s about avoiding making a very bad one.*

### My specific goals for this tutorial:
- transfer knowledge: share with you what I have learned so far
- get your Feedback or more tips to improve my presentations as well
- learn how to prepare a codelab tutorial
- contribute to Lab activity
- do it in 1 week

### Why can it be useful for you?
- gets you aware of parameters you can play with when preparing a talk
- helps to identify your objectives
- helps to accomplish your scientific goal
- helps to transfer a message
- helps to tell *your* story


<!-- ------------------------ -->
## Why
Duration: 2

### Identify your goal

- What is your objective?
- you have a goal, and then you adapt your slides to that goal
- goal comes first: it is not just about making something look nice per sé

Further reading: Introduction in *The Truthful Art: Data, Charts, and Maps for Communication (Voices That Matter)*, by Alberto Cairo

Depending on the goal, you will define a format
You won't be able to pay attention to everything

Is it a job interview? Are you presenting your paper to an expert? Are you teaching?


### Examples / use cases:

#### Lecture/tutorial
- Goal is to teach
- Be as clear as possible
- Explain concepts/equations/logic
- Make it easy and adapted to audience expertise   

#### Committee panel
- Goal is to get a job / grant
- Convince the panel that you are the best person for that position
- Committee are asked to extrapolate the story of each candidate
- You want to give your version of your story, highlight what they should retain, how you are a good fit, what is your specific contribution, your responsibilities

Not about:
- teaching   

#### Scientific seminar
- Goal is to communicate your research results
- make other scientists wanting to read, understand, use, your results
- start new collaborations to develop your idea/tools/results further
- cite your papers


#### TED talk
- Goal is to inspire
- Large audience
- Comprehensible


<!-- ------------------------ -->

#### Interpret your results
- Your visualization can change your interpretation of your data
- Showing a plot

## Who?

Audience, who are you talking to?
One person, panel, large audience
Expert in your field, expert in another field (ex keynote at Europython), public outreach talk.

In most cases, people in the audience are doing you a favour:
- they walked to the seminar room and had to interrupt their work
- they are spending their time to listen to you rather than doing something else
- they have been asked to attend your talk

## Where?

Identify location and which tools you have available

- Small room
- large auditorium
- remotely
- on a laptop screen
- on a large screen
- without a screen
- can I show images, videos
- do I have a microphone

## What?

What is your point? What do you want people to retain from your talk? What are your keywords? What is your story? Prologue/plot/twist/resolution/conclusion

- what to say
- what you don't want to say

### Story

- Introduction

Extremely important, maybe the most important part:

Audience is thinking to other things; and they have to start thinking of what you are thinking; they all have to think to the same thing.
It's strange if you think about it. Not easy to capture attention.
Things are not important 'per sé': they become important if someone listens to them

We will come back to how you do this in the *HOW* section


Structure:

  - Motivation
  - State of the Art
  - Problematic you want to address
  - Characters (main keywords, topic)


- Plot
  - characters evolution ()
  - New problems: ex. your new approach works partially
  - Twist: a new idea, a new method, a new character (ex. you discussed this with someone at NeuroSpin and found out that in neuroscience a similar problem is present)  
  - make it interesting  

- Conclusions
  - Message


## How long?

- How long is your talk?

Bad example:
if you are given 15 minutes, you have to reach your conclusion in 15 minutes

and at minute 15 you say 'I have no time' or you are still in your Introduction
- you are supposed to know how long it is, it shouldn't be a surprise


## How

Slides: text, images (photos/icons), voice/prosody, body language
How long do I need to talk: flash talk, keynote
How long do I have to prep
Compromise: maybe you won’t have time to check everything, or maybe there is no need for it (ex flash talk in a JC) or there is (job interview). You are making choices good to be aware of them or you may be give a message that you are not aware of (ex font)

### Design your slides

- Design style changes and when you choose a font or plot, implicitely you are also pointing to an epoch

### Font

### How to keep attention:

Put your audience in the best condition to listen:
- Don't talk to yourself, no need to give a talk
- Voice: Intensity (the audience has to be able to hear what you are saying)
- I have to tell you immediately why you should listen to me: speech clear, fluent, without too many silent pauses / filled pauses (pause in which there is no silence: disfluences ex. vocalisation (eee, oooo), nasalitasion (mmmm), repetitions (repeat a word), false start (start, then adjust sentence while speaking), prolongations). This is part of spontaneous speech so it is normal (and good) to have some of them, it shows you are thinking and not reading. (Ex. actor reproducing spontenous speech needs to add them)

### In the introduction:

- Avoid very long sentences: you need to capture the attention now, not at the end of 100 words
- Avoid citations (preferable to know what you think)
- Don't read
- No rote speech <!-- a memoria -->
- Advisable to start in a dominated role (i.e. )
  - put the observer in a role which is less problematic, there is nothing to fear, receives information
  -

### In the plot

- use examples, data, plot(s)
- vary your intonation to capture attention with your rythm,
  - some parts may be faster
  - some parts should be slower (important, pay attention)
  - no fear of silences: help to emphasize something, be conscious of them (otherwise hesitation), give the time to the audience to think.
- Test attention and adapt to your audience: decide if a recap is needed, if people are following

### In the Conclusions

- not because time is up
- brief summary
- new proposals
- possibly thank



### Voice
When reading, text gives the main message.
When you speak, things are much more difficult. Text is only a small part of your message.

Example: Yesterday I ate a risotto, how was it? Good.
<!-- ok, decent -->
<!-- gooood, delicious -->
<!-- niente di che, non lo mangerei>
<!--- 3 different risotto's -->

Sometimes we think we have 'just' said 'good morning' and instead we said much more than that. Sometimes we think we said something but the message we gave was actually different.

Many parameters contribute to give your message.

Prosody (not text but how you say it)
Try to change all prosodic elements during your talk.

- volume/intensity high/low
  - How much air you use when you speak <!--(parla a una persona sempre più lontana; difficile passare da alto a basso) -->
  - Pick a person who is far away and talk to that person
  - Don't talk to yourself

- speech rate: (syllables/s)
  - very faste (you don't want too much attention, ex. medicines 9 syll/s)
  - slow (baby-talk, 3-4 syllables/s)
  - talking live or remotely requires also a different speech rate
  - avoid speaking always at the same rate, change it while talking!

  - intonation (high or lower picth)
    - contracting a mussle, the more tense it is, the higher the tone, like for a guitar 

    tono puoi parlare, più tese le corde vocali più alto ; stesso tono: chiesa;

    dominante:
    lento, molti silenzi, president of a country at the end of the year, governement, infastidisco, allontano

    fast, lots of things to say, I think they are all important, not too many silences: at the start the audience is dominant

    if you pick one or the other you may also give the idea of whether you think you are in a higher role (or you put the audience in a lower role)



- emphasis:
  - duration accents
  - tone accent, higher tone peak, i.e. vocal cordes vibrate with higher frequency
- rythm (related to repetition of an event, speech rate, silences)

Example:
The teacher said the detective is a con.

The teacher said // the detective is a con.
The teacher // said the detective // is a con.
Or with higher tone, without pauses:
The *teacher* said the *detective* is a *con*.
The teacher *said* the detective is a *con*.
The teacher *said* the *detective* is a con. (and not a third person)

Who is the con? The teacher or the detective?
What changes is the intonation and silences




The same text can give a different message:

## Exercises
### Exercise 1.
Pronounce 'Good morning' with different intentions and ask someone to guess which intention you sent
- hasty <!-- frettoloso -->
- happy
- sad
- threatening
- afraid
- insincere
- commanding
- enthusiastic

### Exercise 2.
*We'll talk about that tomorrow*
- sad
- enthusiastic
- threatening

### Exercise 3.
Read the numbers choosing one intention among the ones
in brackets
12 34 23 75 (disgust, enthusiasm, resignation)
4 5 7 9 2 (sadness, fear, satisfaction)

### Exercise 4.
Read this text
- First follow syntaptic silences (, . ;)
- Re-read with higher tone or emphasis on italic words

Massive neutrinos influence the background evolution of the Universe as well as the growth of structure. Being able to model this effect and constrain the sum of their masses is one of the key challenges in modern cosmology.

### Help your audience
- simple words
- clear message
- avoid citations, typically not relevant with what you want to saying
- attention to microphone (avoid to move hands while holding a microphone; without microphone one had to calibrate more voice)


Numbers: make contrast with voice, say numbers flat, say numbers creating a list of items, or a list of priorities



### Body language
Depends on situation

- Regard: look at the audience (ex. to all committee panel members)
- Preferably not sitting (removing body language)
- Confortable position, calm and ready to say things that you believe are important



## Summary
- Why: Identify your Goal
- Who: Identify your audience
- Where: Identify where your talk will take place
- What: your story, key message, what should audience retain
- How:
  - slides (tool, background, font, images, plots, icons, etc.)
  - content (which result, plot best illustrate your message?)
  - voice (prosody)
- do not over-do (animations, gifs, transitions, continuous scrolling etc): can be very distracting from your goal
- compromise between reaching max return with minimum effort
- listen to feedback
- Drawback: the more you get aware of choices you have when preparing a talk, the more you will notice them when listening to a talk.

- The only way to improve your talk is to give talks. Accept invitations to give a public speech.
