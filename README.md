Welcome to the CosmoStat C++ Tutorial GitHub Wiki Page!

This repository contains C++ lecture slides including sample codes that I adopted from various sources. These lecture try to help newcomers to learn C++ and solve their programming problems.
This is assumed that readers are already familiar with C, or at least that they do not have any difficulty in reading C code. In other words, those who have experience in C and people who desire to quickly understand the features of modern C++ in a short period of time are well suited togo throgh these lectures.

#### Part 1: Introduction to C++

The objective of this tutorial is to provide a basic introduction to beginners. The level is aimed at individuals with little or no experience whatsoever with C++. This tutorial is more focused on the basics of C/C++. The main features covered in this tutorial are:

1. [Variables -- one of the basic building blocks of computer programs.]
1. [How to make and execute a program.]
1. [How to make our program interactive, by getting input from the user and printing output.]
1. [If-else statement: allows you to introduce a whole new level of interactivity and complexity to your program, conditionally executing code based on user input or calculations. ]
1. [The switch statement allows you to choose between multiple alternatives in C++, like a more efficient and tidier if-else if-else.]
1. [Loops allowing you to control the number of loop iterations in a very flexible way. ]
1. [Arrays let you work with lists of data items, a lot like a shopping list, where item is numbered.]
1. [Pointers are the point at which many beginners give up with C++. They seem like a bit of a mind game when you first start, but as with everything else in programming, if you practice typing, your understanding of them will develop surprisingly.]
1. [Close relationship between pointers and arrays in C++ ]
1. [ Functions are one of the most exciting steps when you're learning programming; finally you can create blocks of reusable code.]
1. [Simple little tutorial on Namespaces let you create self-contained collections of functions in C++, avoiding clashes with similarly-named functions.]


#### Part 2: Classes and Objects

The objective of this tutorial is to provide a more in-depth look at object-oriented Programming.

1. [Classes are all the rage these days in programming, enabling you to model real-world or programming concepts by bundling together code with data.]
